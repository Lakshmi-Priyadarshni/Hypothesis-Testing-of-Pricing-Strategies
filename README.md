# Hypothesis-Testing-of-Pricing-Strategies

This project analyzes the impact of different pricing strategies and charity framing on consumer behavior and profitability at an amusement park. Using a field experiment and hypothesis testing, we evaluated how Flat Rate (FR), Flat Rate with Charity, Name Your Own Price (NYOP), and NYOP with Charity affect purchase rates, willingness to pay, and social surplus.
